# Video-Object-Tracker
Video Object Tracker is a robust and efficient tool for tracking objects in videos. Built using the powerful OpenCV (cv2) library, this project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for detecting and tracking objects across video frames.

# Features
**Real-Time Object Tracking:** Efficiently tracks objects in real-time video streams.
**Multi-Object Tracking:** Capable of tracking multiple objects simultaneously.
**Customizable Tracking Algorithms:** Supports various tracking algorithms provided by OpenCV, such as KCF, TLD, MEDIANFLOW, and more.
**Bounding Box Visualization:** Draws bounding boxes around tracked objects for clear visualization.
**Configurable Parameters:** Allows customization of tracking parameters to enhance accuracy and performance.
